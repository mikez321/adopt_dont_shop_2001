# Adopt Don't Shop
Mod2, Week1 Solo Project

## About
Simple mock pet adoption app built in rails featuring CRUD fuctionality.  Most importantly it features my beagles Sydney and Charlotte, and a dog that looks _almost_ identical to my first real dog friend Huckleberry.

## Requirements
Rails 5.1.7

Ruby 2.5.3

PSQL 12.2

## See it in the wild (Heroku)

## What I learned while building this application
This was my first time moving out of the command line and into the world of seeing my code in Chrome!  This project laid down the foundations of routes, MVC architecture, RSpec testing, and working in PSQL Databases.  It also gave me an appreciation of Front End and design!  As much as I tried for clean lines, it ended up looking like a toothpaste colorway!
